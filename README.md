# L-system

The Lindenmayer system (or L-system) is a parallel rewriting system.

L-systems consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, an initial axiom string from which to begin, production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, and a mechanism translating the generated strings into geometric structures. 

The recursive nature of the L-system rules lead to self-similarity and fractal-like forms. 

# The project
